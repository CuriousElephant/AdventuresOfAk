        <h2>A little about me.</h2>
        <p>Sniffing is my game of choice. There is no better thrill than getting some fresh air. Some say old guys don't have new tricks, well I have a trick for them. It's called a shower, I can smell them coming from miles away!</p1>

        <p>Catching a breeze while I sleep under the trees is another past time of mine. So long as no cats are around.</p2>

        <h3>My evening activities tire me out!</h3>
